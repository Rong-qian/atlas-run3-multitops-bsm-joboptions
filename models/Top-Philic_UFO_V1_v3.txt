This UFO is almost identical to Top-Philic_UFO_V1, except for the fact that the theta1 parameter is accessible and can be configured.
Further, the DSID of the Z' is modified to be 32 (conforming to PDG ID standard naming scheme) and decays of W bosons to leptons have been added by modifying the UFO directly.

This UFO should only be used to generate events at LO.
